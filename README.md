# Welcome
![dependencies][badge-dep] [![language][badge-lang]][link-vjs]

Collection of small UserScript for desperate people (including me) who use somewhat crappy web applications.  
Thoses are __self contained__ script with as __few dependencies__ as possible (goal is zero for each script).

## Phylosophy 
I've build thoses scripts with the open source phylosophy in mind, as described by the [OSD](https://opensource.org/docs/osd).  
As such, you can do whatever you want with these scripts.


## Disclaimer
I make these scripts on my spare time and adapt them to my needs.  
So don't expect me to have solved all the problems you might encounter.  

Moreover, some of these scripts use a __hard coded__ configuration.  
They are quite small thought, so you will be able to easily customize them (if needed).
